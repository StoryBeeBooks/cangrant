## 📋 What You Need to Do Next

### **Step 1: Rename GitHub Repository (5 minutes)**

1. Go to [https://github.com/StoryBeeBooks/cangrant/settings](https://github.com/StoryBeeBooks/cangrant/settings)
2. Scroll to "Repository name"
3. Change to: **`mygrants`**
4. Click "Rename"
5. Update your local git remote:

```powershell
cd C:\src\cangrant
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/StoryBeeBooks/mygrants.git
```

**See full guide:** `GITHUB_RENAME_GUIDE.md`

---

### **Step 2: Rename Local Folder (Optional, 2 minutes)**

```powershell
cd C:\src
Move-Item -Path cangrant -Destination mygrants
cd mygrants
code .
```

Or just rename in Windows Explorer!

---

### **Step 3: Supabase - DON'T Rename! (Recommended)**

**Keep your Supabase project named "cangrant"** - it's just an internal label that users never see!

**Why?**
- ✅ No work required
- ✅ No risk of breaking things
- ✅ Users never see the Supabase project name
- ✅ Your app displays "My-Grants" everywhere that matters

**See full explanation:** `SUPABASE_RENAME_GUIDE.md`

---

### **Step 4: Run Supabase Database Migration (15 minutes)**

You need to set up your grants database:

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in
2. Open your project (currently named "cangrant")
3. Click "SQL Editor" in sidebar
4. Click "New Query"
5. Open `supabase_migration.sql` in this folder
6. Copy ALL the SQL
7. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
8. Click "Run"
9. Verify tables were created (Table Editor → see "grants" table)
10. Make yourself admin (replace with your email):

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

**See full guide:** `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

---

### **Step 5: Test the App (10 minutes)**

After renaming, test that everything still works:

```powershell
# From your project folder (C:\src\mygrants or C:\src\cangrant)
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Test these features:**
- ✅ App launches with "My-Grants" title
- ✅ Authentication (sign up / sign in)
- ✅ Browse grants
- ✅ Save grants
- ✅ Language switching
- ✅ Profile screen

---
