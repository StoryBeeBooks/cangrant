# Complete Supabase Setup Guide (Beyond SQL)

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do in Supabase

After running the SQL code, here are ALL the other things you need to configure in Supabase:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ CRITICAL: Make Yourself Admin (REQUIRED!)

**Why:** So you can add/edit grants later from an admin panel.

**How:**

1. First, create an account in your app (sign up with email)
2. In Supabase, go to: **SQL Editor** ‚Üí **New Query**
3. Run this (replace with YOUR email):

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';
```

4. Verify it worked:

```sql
SELECT user_id, email, role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';
```

Should show `role = 'admin'`.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ CRITICAL: Check RLS Policies (REQUIRED!)

**Why:** Row Level Security protects your data but needs correct policies.

**How:**

### Check Grants Table Policies:

1. Go to: **Table Editor** ‚Üí Select **grants** table
2. Click the **RLS** tab (or **Policies** button)
3. You should see these policies:
   - ‚úÖ "Anyone can view active grants" (SELECT, using: `is_active = true`)
   - ‚úÖ "Only admins can modify grants" (ALL, using: checks admin role)

### Check Tag Tables:

Each of these 6 tables needs policies:
- eligibility_tags
- industry_tags
- type_tags
- grant_eligibility
- grant_industries
- grant_types

**Each should have:**
- ‚úÖ "Anyone can view" (SELECT, no conditions)
- ‚úÖ "Only admins can modify" (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, checks admin role)

### If Policies Are Missing:

The SQL should have created them. If not, tell me and I'll provide the exact policy SQL.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ IMPORTANT: Configure Authentication Settings

**Why:** Control how users sign up and authenticate.

**How:**

1. Go to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers**

### Email Auth Settings:

2. Click **Email** provider
3. Configure:
   - ‚úÖ **Enable Email provider** (turn ON)
   - ‚úÖ **Confirm email** (RECOMMENDED: turn ON for production)
   - ‚úÖ **Secure email change** (turn ON)
   - ‚úÖ **Secure password change** (turn ON)

4. Email Templates (optional for now):
   - You can customize the confirmation email later
   - Default templates work fine for testing

### Disable Unused Providers:

5. Turn OFF providers you don't use:
   - ‚ùå Phone (unless you want SMS auth)
   - ‚ùå Google, GitHub, etc. (unless you want social login)

This reduces attack surface.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ IMPORTANT: Set Up Email Templates (For Production)

**Why:** Professional welcome emails for users.

**How:**

1. Go to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Email Templates**

### Customize These Templates:

#### Confirm Signup:
```
Subject: Welcome to My-Grants!

Hi {{ .Email }},

Thanks for signing up for My-Grants!

Click here to confirm your email: {{ .ConfirmationURL }}

Find your perfect grant at my-grants.com

Best regards,
The My-Grants Team
```

#### Magic Link:
```
Subject: Sign in to My-Grants

Hi {{ .Email }},

Click here to sign in: {{ .MagicLinkURL }}

Best regards,
The My-Grants Team
```

#### Reset Password:
```
Subject: Reset your My-Grants password

Hi {{ .Email }},

Click here to reset your password: {{ .ConfirmationURL }}

If you didn't request this, ignore this email.

Best regards,
The My-Grants Team
```

You can customize these more later!

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ RECOMMENDED: Configure API Settings

**Why:** Control rate limiting and security.

**How:**

1. Go to: **Settings** ‚Üí **API**

### Check These Settings:

- **API URL**: Copy this - you need it in your Flutter app
- **Anon Key**: Copy this - you need it in your Flutter app
- **Service Role Key**: KEEP SECRET! Don't put in app code!

### Rate Limiting (Free Tier):

Default settings are fine:
- 60 requests per minute per IP
- Good enough for development

You can increase this on Pro plan if needed later.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ RECOMMENDED: Set Up Storage Buckets (For Future)

**Why:** If you want to store grant PDFs or images later.

**How (Future - Skip for Now):**

1. Go to: **Storage**
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Name it: "grant-documents"
4. Public: No (keep private)
5. Set up policies later when you need it

**You don't need this yet!** Just for future reference.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ CRITICAL: Test Your Connection

**Why:** Make sure your Flutter app can connect.

**How:**

### Check Your App Has Correct Credentials:

1. In VS Code, open: `lib/services/supabase_service.dart`
2. Look for `Supabase.initialize()`
3. Verify it has:
   - ‚úÖ Correct **url** (from Supabase Settings ‚Üí API)
   - ‚úÖ Correct **anonKey** (from Supabase Settings ‚Üí API)

### Test in Your App:

```powershell
flutter run
```

Try these:
- ‚úÖ Sign up with new email
- ‚úÖ Sign in
- ‚úÖ View grants (should see your 4 sample grants)

If any fail, check:
1. API credentials are correct
2. RLS policies are set up
3. Internet connection works

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ OPTIONAL: Set Up Realtime (For Future)

**Why:** If you want grants to update live in the app without refresh.

**How (Future - Skip for Now):**

1. Go to: **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
2. Click **Enable Replication** for grants table
3. Configure your Flutter app to listen to changes

**You don't need this yet!** Just for future when you have many users.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ OPTIONAL: Configure Webhooks (For Advanced Users)

**Why:** Get notified when events happen (new user, new grant, etc.)

**Skip this for now!** You can set this up later if needed.

---

## üîü IMPORTANT: Backup Configuration

**Why:** Don't lose your data!

**How:**

### Automatic Backups (Pro Plan Only):

Free tier doesn't have automatic backups, but you can manually backup:

1. Go to: **SQL Editor**
2. Run: 

```sql
-- Export all grants
SELECT * FROM grants;
```

3. Copy the data to a spreadsheet occasionally

### Or Use Supabase CLI:

```powershell
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase db dump -f backup.sql
```

**Do this once a week** once you have real data!

## üö® Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Row Level Security policy violation"

**Cause:** RLS is enabled but no policies exist.

**Fix:** Run the policy creation SQL from `SUPABASE_AI_PROMPTS.md` Requirement 3.

---

### Issue 2: "Cannot read grants"

**Cause:** Either no data or RLS blocking access.

**Fix:** 
1. Check grants exist: `SELECT * FROM grants;`
2. Check RLS policies are set up
3. Make sure `is_active = true` on grants

---

### Issue 3: "Cannot create profile"

**Cause:** Profiles table missing or RLS blocking.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure profiles table exists
2. Check RLS policy allows users to insert their own profile
3. Verify trigger creates profile on signup

---

### Issue 4: "Connection refused"

**Cause:** Wrong API URL or network issue.

**Fix:**
1. Double-check API URL in your app matches Supabase
2. Check internet connection
3. Verify Supabase project is not paused
