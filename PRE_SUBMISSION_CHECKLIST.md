if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}
```

Update `signingConfigs` and `buildTypes`:
```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
        keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
        storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
    }
}
