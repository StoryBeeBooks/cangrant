### 3. **New Layout Structure** 📐

The screen now uses a **Stack** layout:

```dart
Stack
├── Background Image (172C.png) - Full screen
└── SafeArea with scrollable content
    ├── Spacer (flexible top spacing)
    ├── Error Message (if any)
    ├── Sign-In Buttons (Google & Apple)
    ├── "Sign in to continue" text
    ├── Terms & Privacy with clickable links
    └── Spacer (flexible bottom spacing)
```

**Benefits:**
- Content is vertically centered
- Background fills entire screen
- No white space or gradient
- Clean, minimal design
- Professional appearance

### 4. **Responsive Design Maintained** 📱

All elements scale dynamically:

**Button Sizing:**
- Width/Height: 18% of screen width (60-80px range)
- Icon size: 12% of screen width (40-52px range)
- Spacing: 4% of screen width

**Text Sizing:**
- "Sign in to continue": 4.5% of screen (16-20px)
- Terms & Privacy: 3% of screen (11-14px)

**Spacing:**
- Vertical: Based on screen height percentages
- Horizontal: Based on screen width percentages

  }
}
```
