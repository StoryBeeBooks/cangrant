## ⚠️ If It Doesn't Work:

### **Common Issue: "API not enabled"**
**Solution:** Wait 5-10 minutes for Google to propagate the changes, then try again.

### **Error: "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"**
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're using a test user account (storybeeonline@gmail.com)
- Check OAuth consent screen has test user added

### **Error: "Sign-in attempt failed"**
**Solution:**
- Check internet connection on emulator
- Make sure Google Play Services is installed on emulator
- Wait a few minutes and try again

### **Error: "12500: Unknown error"**
**Solution:**
- This means SHA-1 mismatch or Client ID is wrong
- Double-check the Android Client ID matches what's in Google Cloud Console
