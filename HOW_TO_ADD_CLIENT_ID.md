# 🔧 How to Add Your Google Client ID (AFTER Setup)

## 📍 Location:
File: `lib/services/supabase_service.dart`
Line: ~71

## 🔍 What to Look For:

Find this code:
```dart
final GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
  serverClientId: Platform.isAndroid
      ? 'YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com' // TODO: Replace
      : null,
);
```

## ✏️ What to Replace:

**BEFORE (with TODO):**
```dart
? 'YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com' // TODO: Replace
```

**AFTER (with your actual Client ID):**
```dart
? '123456789-abc123def456.apps.googleusercontent.com' // Your Android Client ID
```

## 📝 Where to Get Your Client ID:

### Option 1: From Google Cloud Console
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Look for "My-Grants Android App" (type: Android)
3. Click on it
4. Copy the entire Client ID

### Option 2: Just Tell Me!
After you complete the Google OAuth setup:
1. Copy your Android Client ID
2. Send it to me in chat
3. I'll add it to the code for you! 🎯

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

- **Android Client ID** is DIFFERENT from **Web Client ID**
- You need BOTH:
  - **Web Client ID** → Goes into Supabase (you'll paste it there)
  - **Android Client ID** → Goes into this code file (I'll help you add it)

## 🧪 Testing:

**Without Client ID:**
- Google Sign-In button will show
- But clicking it will fail with an error

**With Client ID:**
- Google Sign-In will work! ✨
- You'll see the Google account picker
- You'll be signed in after selecting your account

---

**Don't worry!** Just complete the Google OAuth setup first. Once you have your Client IDs, tell me and I'll update the code for you! 💪
