## 📋 What You Need to Do NOW

### **Action 1: Follow the Setup Guide**

Open the file: **`GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md`**

Follow all 6 steps (takes ~30 minutes total):
1. ⬜ Get SHA-1 fingerprint from your app
2. ⬜ Create Google Cloud project
3. ⬜ Enable Google+ API
4. ⬜ Configure OAuth consent screen
5. ⬜ Create Android OAuth client
6. ⬜ Update Supabase with credentials

### **Action 2: Add Client ID to Your App**

After completing the setup guide, you'll have a Client ID that looks like:
```
1234567890-abc123def456.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Where to add it:**

Open: `lib/services/supabase_service.dart`

Find **line 71** (look for this code):
```dart
final GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
  serverClientId: Platform.isAndroid
      ? 'YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com' // TODO: Replace
      : null,
);
```

**Replace `YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com` with your actual Client ID:**
```dart
final GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
  serverClientId: Platform.isAndroid
      ? '1234567890-abc123def456.apps.googleusercontent.com' // YOUR ID HERE
      : null,
);
```

### **Action 3: Test It!**

1. Save the file after adding your Client ID
2. If your app is running, hot reload it:
   - Press `r` in the terminal where flutter is running
   - Or click the ⚡ icon in VS Code
3. Open the app on your Android emulator
4. Click **"Continue with Google"**
5. Select your Google account
6. ✨ You should be signed in!

**For now:** Just focus on Google Sign-In for Android! 🎉
